Burden of valvular heart diseases: a population-based study
Vuyisile T Nkomo, Julius M Gardin, Thomas N Skelton, John S Gottdiener, Christopher G Scott, Maurice Enriquez-Sarano

Background Valvular heart diseases are not usually regarded as a major public-health problem. Our aim was to assess
their prevalence and eﬀect on overall survival in the general population.
Methods We pooled population-based studies to obtain data for 11 911 randomly selected adults from the general
population who had been assessed prospectively with echocardiography. We also analysed data from a community
study of 16 501 adults who had been assessed by clinically indicated echocardiography.
Findings In the general population group, moderate or severe valve disease was identiﬁed in 615 adults. There was no
diﬀerence in the frequency of such diseases between men and women (p=0·90). Prevalence increased with age, from
0·7% (95% CI 0·5–1·0) in 18–44 year olds to 13·3% (11·7–15·0) in the 75 years and older group (p<0·0001). The
national prevalence of valve disease, corrected for age and sex distribution from the US 2000 population, is 2·5%
(2·2–2·7). In the community group, valve disease was diagnosed in 1505 (1·8% adjusted) adults and frequency
increased considerably with age, from 0·3% (0·2–0·3) of the 18–44 year olds to 11·7% (11·0–12·5) of those aged
75 years and older, but was diagnosed less often in women than in men (odds ratio 0·90, 0·81–1·01; p=0·07). The
adjusted mortality risk ratio associated with valve disease was 1·36 (1·15–1·62; p=0·0005) in the population and 1·75
(1·61–1·90; p<0·0001) in the community.
Interpretation Moderate or severe valvular diseases are notably common in this population and increase with age. In
the community, women are less often diagnosed than are men, which could indicate an important imbalance in view
of the associated lower survival. Valve diseases thus represent an important public-health problem.

Introduction
In the past, valvular heart diseases were typically caused by
rheumatic heart disease, which remains a major burden in
developing countries.1 However, in industrialised countries,
rheumatic disease has fallen substantially,1,2 and residual
valvular diseases are now mostly degenerative3–8 and are not
regarded as a major public-health problem. The low
number of valve replacements, by comparison with
coronary bypass surgery,9 and the low mortality attributed
to valve diseases in the USA lend support to this view.10
However, several facts suggest that the role of valve
disease as a public-health problem should be reconsidered.
Valve diseases are poorly represented in the international
classiﬁcation of diseases, and their contribution to mortality
and morbidity might have been ignored without
echocardiography. Also, the results of the EuroHeart
Survey11 suggest that a substantial burden of such disease
exists, at least in Europe, a situation that is lent support by
the link between degenerative valve disease, older age,3–8
and increasing life expectancy.12
Nevertheless, the burden of valve diseases is unknown
because previous studies have focused mostly on hospital
patients11 and because assessment of valve diseases is
clinically imprecise13 and requires large samples with
echocardiography. Seminal echocardiographic studies
reported some data for valve disease prevalence.6,14–16
Although these and observational17 studies suggest a link
to ageing, the absolute prevalence in speciﬁc age groups
and comprehensive burden of valve diseases are unknown.
Furthermore, in the community—a population that can
inform us about diseases that are of potential concern—
the rates of diagnosed valve diseases are unknown.

We postulated that valvular diseases are highly prevalent
and are a public-health problem. Thus, our aim was to
assess the prevalence, distribution patterns, and
consequences of noteworthy (moderate or severe)
left-sided valve disease in the general population and in
the community.

Methods
Study population
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)
organises the gathering of data from large
epidemiological studies with well-characterised
population samples. From this database, we selected
studies with prospectively deﬁned echocardiographic
valvular analysis. Echocardiography with comprehensive,
speciﬁc valvular analysis was done prospectively in three
large national population-based epidemiological
studies—the Coronary Artery Risk Development in
Young Adults (CARDIA) Study,18 the Atherosclerosis
Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study,19 and the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).20 All these studies
had strictly deﬁned criteria; technical approaches,
design, rationale, and selection criteria were much the
same, and all participants were randomly selected from
the population.
The NHLBI included 5115 participants aged 18–30 years
who had been recruited in 1985–86 from the CARDIA
Study (46% black, 54% white), 15 792 participants aged
45–64 years recruited between 1987 and 1989 in the ARIC
Study (26% black, 72% white), and 5888 participants aged
65 years and older recruited between 1989 and 1992 (16%
black, 84% white) in CHS. Echocardiographs were

obtained in 1989–92 from 4351 CARDIA and 5125 CHS
participants, and in 1994–96 from 2435 ARIC participants.
We assessed these 11 911 individuals from the NHLBI
studies as our sample of the general US population. We
reviewed the original prospectively deﬁned echocardiographic criteria for valve diseases and data sets
were merged. The participant population was diverse for
age, sex, and race (40% black, 59% white, and 1% other)
and by design oversampled the elderly population
compared with the general population. The study was
approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.
Community studies, by contrast with systematic
samples of the general population, analyse diseases as
they are diagnosed in the population. The Mayo Clinic
(Rochester, MN, USA) is the sole provider of
echocardiographic services in Olmsted County. The
Rochester epidemiology project allows information
about all clinical cases of valve disease in Olmsted
County to be obtained through a medical-records linkage
system that encompasses care delivered to residents of
Rochester and Olmsted County by the Mayo Clinic and
other providers in the community.21 More than 90% of
the population of Olmsted County has at least one
medical contact in every 3-year period with these
providers.21 The demographic characteristic of Olmsted
County from the 2000 census was 2·7% black and 90·3%
white. Echocardiographs done in 1990–2000 of adult
Olmsted County residents 18 years or older were
obtained, unless they had previously denied research
authorisation in accordance with Minnesota law or if
they were incarcerated in the federal medical centre. To
estimate the prevalence of valve diseases in the
community, residents with moderate or more severe
valve disease who were alive in January, 2000, were
retained. The echocardiograph closest to January, 2000,
was used when more than one was available. We
examined the outcome in residents diagnosed with valve
disease between 1990 and 1995 to determine the eﬀect of
the presence of such conditions on survival.

In the Olmsted County community, valvular stenosis
assessment was made on the basis of quantitative criteria.
Moderate or more severe valve stenosis (aortic and mitral)
was diagnosed if valve area was smaller or equal to
1·5 cm², as determined by doppler measurement.27
Colour doppler was used to assess presence and severity
of aortic24 and mitral regurgitation.25 Quantitative
regurgitation measures were in development during the
study period and, where done, were integrated into the
grading of mitral and aortic valve regurgitation severity.26

Procedures

Role of the funding source

Prospectively deﬁned diagnostic criteria, which formed
part of the study protocols, were much the same in the
three population-based studies. Judicious, comprehensive
assessment was applied to ensure that all clinically
signiﬁcant valve diseases were noted. Speciﬁcally,
valvular stenosis of moderate or high severity was judged
present if valve leaﬂet motion was obviously limited or if
increased ﬂow velocity across the valve suggested such a
degree of stenosis.22,23 Detection and gradation of valvular
regurgitation was made on the basis of standard colour
doppler criteria for aortic regurgitation (width of
regurgitant colour jet area half or more of the width of
the left ventricular outﬂow tract)24 and mitral regurgitation
(maximum displacement of atrial area by regurgitant
colour ﬂow jet equal or greater than a third in any view),25
in agreement with current guidelines.26

The NHLBI designed the population studies, was made
aware of the analysis done by the investigators, but did
not inﬂuence data analysis and interpretation. The
investigators designed this study and did the analysis
and interpretation. The corresponding author had full
access to all the data in the study and had ﬁnal
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Statistical analysis
We calculated the ratio of participants aﬀected to those
examined to estimate age-speciﬁc and sex-speciﬁc
frequencies of valve diseases in the sampled population.
Age-speciﬁc and sex-speciﬁc valve disease rates were
compared between groups with Z scores; we tested for
trends across age groups with the Cochran-Armitage test.
Because the epidemiological studies oversampled older
participants, the national prevalence of valvular heart
diseases was estimated by adjustment of participant
frequencies with data from the US 2000 population
census. 95% CIs were calculated with Poisson standard
errors. Logistic regression was done to test the association
of sex and age with the presence of valve disease. We
analysed the echo doppler and morphological (left
ventricular and atrial) alterations associated with every
valve disease and tested for signiﬁcance with the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. Survival after diagnosis was estimated by
the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons of survival
between population-based participants with and without
valve disease were done with the two-sample log-rank
test and were adjusted for age, sex, left ventricular
ejection fraction, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary
artery disease with the Cox’s proportional hazards model.
Survival after diagnosis in community residents was
compared with that of Minnesota white population,
matched for age and sex, and tested with one-sample
log-rank test. All p values were two-tailed.

Results
There were 11 911 echocardiographs in the pooled
population-based studies. The number of adult residents
of Olmsted County alive in January, 2000, with available
echocardiographs was 16 501, which represents 18·6%
of the adult population of Olmsted County.
In the population-based studies, valvular heart disease
was present in 615 (5·2%, 95% CI 4·8–5·6) participants.

Prevalence of moderate or severe valve disease (%)

The national prevalence of valve diseases, taking into
account the oversampling of the elderly population, and
after adjustment for the national age and sex distribution
of the US 2000 population census, was 2·5% (95% CI
2·2–2·7; table 1). Of the diseases studied, mitral
regurgitation was the most common, and mitral stenosis
the least common. The prevalence of valve disease rose
strikingly with advancing age (table 1 and ﬁgure 1). A
large increase in the prevalence of mitral regurgitation
was seen with ageing (table 1). Adjusted for sex, the odds
ratio for the association of valve disease with increasing
age (per 10 years) was signiﬁcant for mitral regurgitation
(1·84, 95% CI 1·70–1·99; p<0·0001), mitral stenosis (1·65,
1·12–2·43; p=0·01), aortic regurgitation (1·49, 1·30–1·70;
p<0·0001), and aortic stenosis (2·51, 2·02–3·12;
p<0·0001). There was no diﬀerence in age-adjusted valve
disease rates in men versus women for most valve
diseases (mitral regurgitation, p=0·67; mitral stenosis,
p=0·74; aortic regurgitation, p=0·92). However, there was
a trend for higher prevalence of aortic valve stenosis in
men (p=0·06) than in women, and, after adjustment for
age, men had higher rates of aortic stenosis than had
women (odds ratio 1·52, 1·02–2·26; p=0·04).
In Olmsted County, clinically diagnosed valvular heart
disease was identiﬁed in 1505 residents (1·8% adjusted
to the adult US population). A signiﬁcant increase in the
prevalence of clinical valvular disease with age was seen
in both men and women (ﬁgure 1 and table 2). Mitral
regurgitation was the most commonly diagnosed valvular
disease (1·0%, 0·9–1·1); the least common was mitral
stenosis (0·04%, 0·03–0·05). The frequency of mitral
valvular disease was higher than aortic valve disease
(1·0% [0·9–1·1] vs 0·9% [0·8–0·9]; p=0·007). Valvular
diseases were more commonly diagnosed in men than in
women (p<0·0001 after adjustment for age. Odds ratio
0·90, 0·81–1·01, p=0·07 after adjustment for the entire
county population and age).

without such disease (p<0·0001, ﬁgure 2A). The
adjusted relative risk of death associated with valvular
disease was 1·36 (1·15–1·62; p=0·0005). In 971 Olmsted
County residents diagnosed with valvular disease
between 1990 and 1995, observed survival was 56% (1·6)
at 5 years, compared with an expected survival of 73%.
At 8 years, observed survival was 41% (1·7) versus an
expected 61% (p<0·0001, ﬁgure 2B). The risk of death
associated with valve diseases relative to expected (for
same age and sex) in Olmsted County was 1·75
(1·61–1·90; p<0·0001).

Discussion
Our study has shown that the population burden of
clinically noteworthy valvular heart diseases is
considerable in the US population. This burden is also
notable for clinically diagnosed valve disease in the
community. The diﬀerence between the prevalence of
such diseases in the population and the percentage of
people diagnosed with valvular heart diseases in the
community (2·5% vs 1·8%) is probably due to
undiagnosed valve diseases.
Valve diseases detected in the general population and
diagnosed in the community are not mere imaging
peculiarities but are, in both settings, associated with
characteristics of pressure or volume overload and
independent determinants of subsequent mortality.
Thus, these observations underscore the relevance of
our ﬁndings and the need for enhanced research and
therapeutic eﬀorts directed towards valvular diseases.
Men and women are aﬀected by valve diseases to much
the same extent in the population, but women are less
often diagnosed in the community, suggesting
a diagnostic imbalance that could have serious
consequences for women with valve diseases.
The EuroHeart survey11 attracted attention to the
frequent and severe clinical presentation of valve
diseases, but the burden of valve diseases cannot be
fully appreciated by incident clinical cases of valve
diseases that are mostly discovered on the basis of
hospitalisation or surgical series. Our study provides
information on valve disease in the general population
(ie, diagnosed or not) and in the community (ie,
individuals coming to clinical attention). Large,
randomly selected samples of the US population provide
a unique view of the burden of valve diseases in the
general population. By use of the 2000 US population
census to account for the prospective oversampling of
the elderly population, our estimate of the prevalence of
valve diseases in adults corresponds to a 2000 burden of
4·2–5·6 million adults with valve diseases in the USA.
Consistent patterns of distribution of valve diseases
in the general population and in the community show
that older age is an independent determinant of all
forms of valve disease that arise with considerable
frequency in elderly people, in accord with the notion
that the burden of valve disease increases with ageing.
www.thelancet.com Vol 368 September 16, 2006

Such a trend was suspected on the basis of the age and
causal factors in patients with valve diseases who were
referred to surgery and in those who participated in the
prospective EuroHeart survey,11 and from small
population subsets.6,14–16 Our study deﬁnes the prevalence
of valve diseases in all adult segments of the population
with robust estimates, which is a result of the coherent
and comprehensive echocardiographic methodology in
the series we analysed. Importantly, our study shows not
only the trend of increasing prevalence with age but also
very high absolute rates of valve diseases in elderly
people. Indeed, more than one in eight people
aged 75 and older have a moderate or severe valve
disease. Thus, with the projected shift to an older and
larger population,12 the burden of valvular diseases will
probably increase substantially in the future, despite the
fall in rheumatic heart disease. The narrow CIs and high
coherence between population and community data
leave little doubt that this burden is high and will rise.
Not all patients with valve disease are diagnosed and
treated, as shown by the lower detection of valve disease
in the community than found in the general population.
This diﬀerence is probably due to the need for
echocardiography to be clinically indicated before
diagnosis is made, and could have serious consequences
for undiagnosed patients, in view of the outcome
implications of valve diseases. Aortic stenosis showed
the least diﬀerence between population and community,
possibly because of poor clinical tolerance,28 but its high
prevalence in elderly individuals is conﬁrmed by the
population-based Helsinki Ageing Study.16 This gap in
clinical diagnosis of valve diseases, particularly in
elderly patients, underscores the importance of
quantitative echocardiography29 whenever the diagnosis
is suspected or is simply a possible explanation for
unexplained symptoms.
Although most valvular diseases were equally
diagnosed in men and women in the population groups,
mitral and aortic regurgitation was more often
diagnosed in men than in women in the community
setting. Reported surgical series of mitral or aortic
regurgitation consistently show a male predominance
of 60–75%.30,31 The imbalance of sex ratios between valve
regurgitations identiﬁed in the general population and
those diagnosed in the community or operated on in
surgical series is important and could indicate a sex
bias in referral patterns for diagnosis and treatment.
The mechanisms for such an imbalance should be
investigated prospectively.
The valve diseases detected here are not only benign
imaging observations but have profound consequences,
with cardiac remodelling and excess mortality recorded
in the population and in the community despite the
availability of radical treatment with surgical valve
repair or replacement.28 We adjusted excess mortality
for coronary disease and for expected mortality to
remove the potential role of coronary or comorbid

diseases in our estimation of the risk. The excess risk
associated with valve disease indicates the importance
of early detection of valve diseases. Early detection is
key to improving prognosis, since the EuroHeart survey
showed that many patients are denied intervention
despite deﬁnite guideline-based indications, mostly
because of older age.32 Not all elderly patients can be
candidates for surgery—eg, because of comorbid
conditions—emphasising the importance of emerging
percutaneous therapeutic approaches.
Echocardiography is the only method available to
estimate the frequency and distribution of valve disease
in large populations,33 and cannot be corroborated by
other tests (eg, catheterisation) because of the risk and
cost. Studies where valve disease is the primary focus
could provide higher sensitivity in detecting such
diseases, but are not available. Valve disease aetiology
encompasses many causes (eg, rheumatic vs
degenerative), but our study does not address this issue.
Nonetheless, we present a broad descriptive view of the
distribution pattern of clinically signiﬁcant valve
diseases in the general population and community.
We did not reread original echocardiographs, and
valve disease assessment in the population-based
studies was either qualitative or semi-quantitative;
detailed
assessment
with
more
quantitative
measurements was not done.26,34 However, those
individuals identiﬁed with valve diseases showed
cardiac remodelling consistent with the haemodynamics
of each particular valve lesion,35 which we judged
appropriate for the identiﬁcation of a particular valve
disease. Nevertheless, future studies using quantitative
measurements in the population are warranted.
The generalisability of the data presented here is
essential. In a model that adjusted for age, the NHLBI
studies showed no signiﬁcant heterogeneity of valve
disease assessment. Furthermore, the careful sampling
of the general population in the NHLBI studies, and the
coherence between population and community, provide
a robust assessment of the burden of valve disease.
The high prevalence of valvular heart diseases,
together with its increase with ageing, indicate a high
and increasing burden of such conditions. Valve
diseases are underdiagnosed in the community,
especially in women, which could represent an
important bias, since these diseases are associated with
serious physiological and outcome consequences.
Valvular heart diseases represent an underappreciated
yet serious and growing public-health problem that
should be addressed with appropriate resources to
improve diagnosis, treatment, and research.
