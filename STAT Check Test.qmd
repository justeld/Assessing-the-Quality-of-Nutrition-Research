## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
install.packages("statcheck")
library(statcheck)
```

Try it on a raw text string as a test
```{r}
txt <- "blablabla the effect was very significant (t(48) = 1.02, p < .05)"
statcheck(txt)
```

Try it on a pdf

```{r}
#Try setting the working directory
